# review

[English](review.md) · [Русский](../ru/review.md)

A kitten for [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/): a two-pane overlay for
reviewing uncommitted git changes. On the left, a tree of changed files; on the
right, a **unified diff** with **syntax highlighting**, live as you navigate.

Two view modes — the whole file, or just the changed hunks:

![review — hunks-only view](../img/review-hunks.png)

Plus a third view (`v`) — **final code**, the way an IDE shows it: the whole file with no
`+`/`−` signs and no removed lines; edits are marked in the gutter.

## What it can do

- Shows the **uncommitted changes** in the working tree (vs `HEAD`), untracked files included.
- On the left, a **tree** of files (folders in blue, files colored by status `M`/`A`/`D`/`R`).
- On the right, the **unified diff** of the selected file: additions in green `+`, deletions in red `−`,
  context with IDE-grade **syntax highlighting** (Pygments): functions, types, `self`,
  decorators, docstrings, f-strings — by file extension. Updates instantly as you move.
- **Word-diff**: in a removed/added line pair, the words that actually changed
  are highlighted more brightly, not the whole line.
- **Two view modes** (`a`): hunks only (changes with context) or the **whole file**
  expanded, with changes marked inline.
- **Final code** (`v`) — an IDE-style view: read the code as it will look after the merge.
  No `+`/`−`, no removed lines, no highlighting inside the lines — just a gutter marker
  (`▎` green — added, `▎` blue — modified, `▔` red — something was cut here). To see what
  exactly changed within a line, switch back to the unified view. Jumps, comments, copying
  and search work as in the diff, and the cursor stays on the same line when you switch.
- **A change map on the scrollbar** to the right of the diff — colored ticks show where the
  edits are (green — added, blue — modified, red — deleted), so you can see where to scroll.
- **Jump between changes** (`[` / `]`) — across edit blocks within the diff (in both modes).
- **Per-file line stats** in the tree (`+added −removed`), like in an IDE/GitHub.
- **Unversioned Files** — untracked files are gathered into their own group at the bottom
  of the tree, collapsed by default, so a pile of new files doesn't bury the changes you
  came to review.
- **Stage from the tree** (`+`) — `git add` the file under the cursor, a whole folder, or
  every untracked file at once (`+` on the group node).
- **Revert changes** (`-`) — drop the edits of the file/folder under the cursor back to
  `HEAD` (both the working tree and the index). Asks for confirmation first: only `y`
  goes through. Untracked files have nothing to revert to, so they are **deleted**, and
  the prompt says so.
- **Sticky header**: while scrolling, the enclosing function/class is pinned at the top.
- **Horizontal scroll** for long lines (`h` / `l`).
- **Scrollbars** in both panes; the mouse wheel scrolls the pane it's over, without
  moving the selection.
- **Comments → markdown** — you comment on lines right in the diff (multi-line: `Shift+Enter`);
  pressing `w` collects all comments into markdown, copies them to the clipboard to feed
  back to Claude ("here are the comments, fix them") and clears them. Closes the
  review → edit loop.
- **Refresh** (`r`) — rescan changes without reopening the overlay (handy while Claude
  is still editing files).
- **Open in editor** (`e`) — open the current file at the visible line. The editor is chosen
  by project config: `.idea/` → JetBrains (PhpStorm/IDEA/PyCharm/…), `.vscode/` → VS Code,
  `.cursor/` → Cursor, `.zed/` → Zed — the **whole project** opens focused on the line,
  and the **overlay stays open**. If there's no config — `$VISUAL`/`$EDITOR`, otherwise
  `vim` in a new tab (in which case the overlay closes — a terminal editor needs a terminal).
- **Search the diff** (`/`, navigate with `n` / `N`) with match highlighting.
- Filter the tree by file name (`f`), Russian keyboard layout for shortcuts.

The project folder and git root are determined from the `cwd` of the window the hotkey was pressed in.

## Setup

```sh
familiar enable review
```

Reload the config with `Cmd+Ctrl+,` (macOS) or restart kitty. Open: `cmd+shift+r`.

Minimal fallback — a manual `map` in `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf` (or an
included file):

```conf
map cmd+shift+r kitten /path/to/familiar/plugins/review.py
```

Unlike `familiar enable`, this bare map lacks the toggle-to-close behavior, the
guard against re-opening the overlay on top of itself, the Cyrillic key
duplicates, and the `cmd+c` / `cmd+shift+c` pass-through for copying inside the
overlay.

## Keys

Two focus areas: the **tree** (left, navigate files) and the **diff** (right, cursor over
lines for comments). Switch with `Tab` or the arrows `←` (tree) / `→` (diff).

**Mouse**: click a file in the tree to select it; click a folder to select it, click it
again to fold/unfold; click a diff line to place the cursor,
**double-click** to open a comment; click the `┈` separator to reveal hidden lines.
(While mouse capture is on, select text for copying with `Shift` held down.)

**Tree focus**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑/↓` | navigate files (the diff on the right updates) |
| `g` / `G` | first / last file |
| `Enter` `Space` | collapse/expand folder |
| `→` `Tab` | go to the diff (cursor over lines) |
| `+` | `git add` the file / folder / all Unversioned Files under the cursor |
| `-` | revert changes to `HEAD` (new files are deleted); asks `y` to confirm |
| `r` | rescan changes (refresh) |
| `u` | show/hide noisy folders (`.idea`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, …) |
| `f` | filter the tree by file name |
| `q` `Esc` | quit |

**Diff focus** (`→`/`Tab` from the tree; `←`/`Tab`/`Esc` — back to the tree)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑/↓` | move cursor over diff lines |
| `g` / `G` | to the start / end of the diff |
| `Enter` | on the `┈` separator — reveal hidden context lines |
| `Enter` / `c` | comment on the line under the cursor (empty — delete one) |
| `{` / `}` | jump to the previous / next comment (`●`) |
| `w` | collect all comments into markdown, copy to the clipboard and clear them |
| `x` | delete all comments |
| `[` / `]` | previous / next change |

**While typing** (comment / filter / search)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | save (in a comment: an empty text deletes it) |
| `Shift+Enter` | new line — comments are multi-line and wrap by words |
| `Ctrl+W` | erase the word before the cursor |
| `Ctrl+U` | erase the whole text |
| `Esc` | cancel |

**Common (in both focus areas)**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `PgUp` `PgDn` | scroll the diff (also `Ctrl+U` / `Ctrl+D`) |
| `h` / `l` | horizontal scroll of the diff (long lines) |
| `a` | view mode: hunks only ↔ whole file |
| `v` | pane view: unified diff ↔ final code (IDE-style) |
| `/` `n`/`N` | search the diff and jump between matches |
| `⌘c` | copy: in the tree — `@path` of the file/folder, in the diff — the selection / line under the cursor |
| `⌘shift+c` | copy `@path#L42` (in the tree — `@path`) |
| `e` | open the file in the project IDE (`.idea`/`.vscode`/`.cursor`/`.zed`) or `$EDITOR` |

File statuses (colored as in an IDE): `A` added — green, `M` modified — blue,
`D` deleted — red, `R` renamed — cyan, `?` untracked (new, not yet in git) —
**red** (the file is shown but marked as not added to git).

Untracked files are gathered into an **Unversioned Files** group at the bottom of the
tree, collapsed by default. `+` on the group node stages all of them at once; `+` on a
file or a folder stages just that. The hint only shows up when there is actually
something to add — an already staged file offers nothing.

`-` reverts instead: the file goes back to its `HEAD` version, in the working tree and in
the index alike, and an untracked file is deleted from disk — irreversibly, git has no
copy of it. Nothing happens until you press `y`; `Enter`, `Esc` and every other key
cancel.

Noisy IDE folders (`.idea`, `.vscode`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `dist`, `venv`,
etc.) are hidden by default — as in an IDE; `u` shows them (and says how many). They are
never staged by `+` while hidden.

## Working with Claude Code

### Comments back to Claude

1. `Tab` — go to the diff, `↑/↓` — land on a line.
2. `Enter` or `c` — write a comment (a `●` appears next to the line). `Shift+Enter` —
   a new line; the text wraps by words, `Ctrl+W` / `Ctrl+U` erase a word / everything.
3. Go through all the spots, across different files.
4. `w` — all comments are collected into markdown, **copied to the clipboard** and
   cleared from the diff:

   ```markdown
   # Review comments

   ## app/Http/Controllers/UserController.php
   - **L42** `return $user->save();`
     no permission check, add authorize()
   ```

5. Paste (`Cmd+V`) into the Claude chat: "here are the review comments, fix them."

### Paths and lines

Besides collecting comments, the diff is a quick way to point Claude Code at a specific
spot in the code. Both keys copy an **@-mention** with a path relative to the repository
root — the form Claude Code expects:

- `⌘c` copies `@path/to/file.py` of the selected file, or `@path/to/dir/` of a folder
  (tree focus); in the diff it copies the **selection / line under the cursor** as code.
- `⌘shift+c` copies `@path/to/file.py#L42`, or `@path/to/file.py#L42-58` when a range of
  lines is selected with the mouse.

Claude Code resolves `@path` against the directory it was started in, so this works when
you run `claude` from the project root. Land on a line in the diff → `⌘shift+c` → `Cmd+V`
into the prompt — no need to describe the spot in words ("in such-and-such file, somewhere
near that function").

## What's compared with what

The file list is `git status` (plus untracked); each file's diff is the version in
`HEAD` ("before") against the file on disk ("after"). It answers the question "what
have I changed since the last commit".

For untracked files and for a repository without commits the "before" side is empty:
the whole file shows up as added.
